This is the full implementation of our code developed for our project.  Note that some components which are not included in this repository include the NICTA/DATA61 proprietary code for the Indigo TSG solver as well as the real-world data files from the paper.  Both of these are owned by our industry partners and cannot be released publicly.

**Note:** Parts of this code are depenedent on Matlab (which we do not provide) and other parts are reliant on the [Concord TSP solver](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde.html).
